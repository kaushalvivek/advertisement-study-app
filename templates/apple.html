              Apple executives met with Indian government officials on Wednesday to discuss a plan to make iPhones in
              the
              southern city of Bangalore, a person familiar with the talks told CNNMoney.

              India's commerce ministry confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to comment on what was
              discussed.
              In a statement, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) said it appreciated the "constructive and open dialogue we've had
              with
              government about further expanding our local operations." But it would not go into detail.
